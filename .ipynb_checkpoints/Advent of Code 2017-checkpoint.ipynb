    "You find a program trying to generate some art. It uses a strange process that involves repeatedly enhancing the detail of an image through a set of rules.\n",

    "The image consists of a two-dimensional square grid of pixels that are either on (`#`) or off (`.`). The program always begins with this pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "..#\n",

    "\n",
    "- If the size is evenly divisible by `2`, break the pixels up into `2x2` squares, and convert each `2x2` square into a 3x3 square by following the corresponding enhancement rule.\n",

    "The artist's book of enhancement rules is nearby (your puzzle input); however, it seems to be missing rules. The artist explains that sometimes, one must rotate or flip the input pattern to find a match. (Never rotate or flip the output pattern, though.) Each pattern is written concisely: rows are listed as single units, ordered top-down, and separated by slashes. For example, the following rules correspond to the adjacent patterns:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When searching for a rule to use, rotate and flip the pattern as necessary. For example, all of the following patterns match the same rule:\n",

    ".#.   .#.   #..   ###\n",

    "--+--\n",

    "Each of these squares matches the same rule (`../.# => ##./#../...`), three of which require some flipping and rotation to line up with the rule. The output for the rule is the same in all four cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "##.|##.\n",
